# Anomaly Detection with SSIM-Autoencoder
 SSIM-Autoencoder is Variant of Autoencoder that changes the Loss function from MSE to SSIM.
 SSIM is an Index used to evaluate
 Image Similarity in terms of
 luminance, contrast,andstructure.
 <br>
 The goal of training is to enable the autoencoder to learn the features of normal data and reconstruct them effectively. This will ensure that abnormal data cannot be reconstructed well, and thus anomalies can be detected.

# Overview
This jupyter notebook explains the results of anomaly detection for sound data with SSIM-Autoencoder
